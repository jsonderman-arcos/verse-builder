# Project Development Notes

## Current Session Progress
1. Adding widget for testing
2. Test logins
3. 

### Issues Resolved
1. **Password Reset Page 404**: Fixed Netlify routing with proper `_redirects` file
2. **Blank Page Issue**: Added error boundaries and better error handling in AuthProvider and main components
3. **Clock Skew Error**: Implemented server-side password reset using Supabase Edge Function to avoid client-side JWT timing issues
4. **Admin Policy Recursion**: Fixed infinite recursion in `admin_users` RLS policy by creating security definer function

### Current Status
- Password reset functionality implemented with server-side Edge Function
- Admin dashboard with user management capabilities
- Authentication system with proper error handling
- Bible verse memorization exercises (typing, fill-blanks, reference quiz, reflection)

### Recent Changes Made
1. Created `supabase/functions/reset-password/index.ts` - Server-side password reset handler
2. Updated `src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx` - Simplified client-side reset flow
3. Created migration `fix_admin_policy_recursion.sql` - Fixed RLS recursion issue
4. Updated Navigation and Admin components to use new admin check function

### Known Issues
- Need to test password reset flow end-to-end
- Admin functionality needs testing after RLS policy fix

### Next Steps
1. Test password reset functionality thoroughly
2. Verify admin dashboard works without recursion errors
3. Continue with verse memorization features
4. Add progress tracking and analytics
5. Implement user settings and preferences
6. Move Sign In Sign Up under avatar icon
7. Test and fix speech to text
8. add in TTS voice for read-aloud
9. Add in different practice exercises and mix them up each da of the week
